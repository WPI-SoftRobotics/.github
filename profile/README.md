# Welcome to the WPI Soft Robotics Lab!

The Soft Robotics Lab at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, headed by Prof. Cagdas Onal, is the premier robotics research lab on campus in the field of soft robotics and hybrid robots. Our mission is to revolutionize the field of robotics by creating innovative, adaptable, and intelligent soft robotic systems. We aim to enhance the interaction between robots and their environments through groundbreaking research in areas such as adaptable grippers, origami-inspired designs, and wearable haptic interfaces.
